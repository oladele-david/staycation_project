## Additional Tips

- **Break down your work** into small, logical commits. Avoid large, monolithic commits.
- **Write clear and concise commit messages**. The subject should be no longer than 50 characters, and the body, if necessary, should provide more details.
- **Give context** in your commit messages when necessary, especially if the change is not immediately obvious.
- **Use the imperative mood** in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
- **Test your changes** before committing to ensure they work as expected.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your commit history is clean, meaningful, and easy to understand. Happy coding!
